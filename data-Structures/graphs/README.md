# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.


## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:



## Approach & Efficiency
AddNode()
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node
AddEdge()
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
GetNodes()
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
GetNeighbors()
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
Size()
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
